# Robot_Arm_Control_Panel

This project is a web-based control panel for a 6-servo robotic arm, built using XAMPP.
It allows full control of servo positions via sliders and stores custom poses in a MySQL database.

> The webpage can be accessed from other devices (e.g. phone, tablet, or ESP32) using the local IP of the XAMPP server.
